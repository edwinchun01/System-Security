    <h2>What Is Encryption?</h2>
    <p>
        Encryption protects information by converting readable data into coded text 
        that only someone with the correct key can access. It is one of the most important 
        tools used to secure personal, financial, and private information.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Encryption Matters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Protects private information from unauthorized access</li>
        <li>Keeps online banking and payments safe</li>
        <li>Secures emails, messages, and digital communication</li>
        <li>Prevents identity theft and data breaches</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Types of Encryption</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Symmetric Encryption:</strong> Uses one key to both encrypt and decrypt data. It is fast and commonly used for large data sets.</li>
        <li><strong>Asymmetric Encryption:</strong> Uses a public key to encrypt and a private key to decrypt. Often used in secure websites and email systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real-World Use</h2>
    <p>
        Companies like Cloudflare use strong encryption systems such as AES-256 to protect 
        stored data and TLS encryption to secure data sent across networks. These technologies 
        ensure that sensitive information stays private during transmission.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Encryption is essential in today’s digital world. It protects sensitive information, 
        supports online privacy, and ensures secure communication. As cyber threats continue 
        to grow, reliable encryption remains one of the strongest defenses for individuals and 
        organizations.
