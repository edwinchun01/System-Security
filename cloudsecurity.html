        <h2>What is Cloud Security </h2>
        <p> 
            When we hear about system security what comes to mind? Is it having security? is it protecting what we have stored in this imaginary cloud? 
            Cloud Security according to Google is a set of policies, and controls put in place to help protect cloud-based data, apps from any threats and having access. The job of cloud compuing is to make sure to deliver services
            it can be software or even hardware. 
        </p>


        <!--section 2 -->
         <h2> The importance of Cloud Security </h2>

        <p> 
            Why should we care about cloud security? For the most part many of us have many devices and can see our pictures
            we can see it in our phones, computers, tablets and even on our smartwatches. This is possible thanks to having something
            called cloud computing. As much it helps it has its downsides and thats that it can be vunerable to cyberattacks and our information
            could be leaked to those who want to use it for the wrong reasons.
        </p>

        <!--section 3 -->
        <h2> The risks </h2>
        <p>
            As we have mentioned there will alwyas be risk to having things in the cloud and although security can do much we should always know the risk. In a reading
            from CrowdStrike titled 12 Cloud Security Issues: Risk, Threats, and challenges one of the many issues that cloude-security faces is human error. They mentioned
            that "through 2025, 99% of all cloud security failure will be due to some level of human error". This is a major risk many will have faced because as humans we can make
            mistakes and these mistakes cost bigger issues. Another risk  that can ocur is having a data breach. Data breaches have always been around and have also made it to national news. 
            Data breaches happen when sensative files or information is taken from our hands or from the cloud without or permission. Attackers always look at ways of how to breach our cloud 
            because with that infromation they can sell it for profit. 
        </p>

         <!--Section 4-->
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            In conclusion cloud security is an important key to system security because it can protect sensitive data, applicationg and even protect individuals or companies from being attacked. 
        </p>
