            <h2> What is System Security?</h2>
            <p>
                System security is simply proctecintg our computer system, networks and date from those who want to take it and sell it for others to use. For this 
                project we decided to work on system security because it's an important topic that many might not know. We have written subtopics that relate to system 
                security and how it helps us stay safe while using our computers every day.

            <li>
                Encryption: Encryption protects digital information by converting it into unreadable text that only the correct key 
                can unlock. It is essential for online banking, secure messaging, protected passwords, and preventing 
                unauthorized access. My section explains the types of encryption, why it is important, and how businesses 
                use it to keep data safe.
            </li>
            <!--Cloud security-->
            <li>
                Cloud Security: Cloud security is in charge of protecting what's saved on the cloud other may know it as icloud for those who use Apple
                products. It protects companies and individuals from having their information being leaked and it also ensure that files don't go missing. In this section 
                you will learn more about why we need it, the risk that can come up, and the importance to our main topic, system security.
